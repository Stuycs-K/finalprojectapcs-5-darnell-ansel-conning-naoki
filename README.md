# Project Description

An agent-based 2D predator-prey population simulation. The model incorporates dynamics such as growth and death, movement, encounters, varying terrains, and more. Each agent is associated with a feature vector, containing age, hunger (predator), and location, which are incorporated into the different dynamics of the model. The user is able to view populations of the predator, prey, and the ratio between them, graphed on a second window. Finally, the user can control the simulation's parameters in real-time through a third window (growth rate, move rate, etc.) and start/pause the simulation. 

# Intended usage:

The intended usage of this simulation is to better understand the interactions and behaviors of predators and prey, when on a 2d plane. It also doubles as a fun game and a simulation to play around with. It is interesting to note the large variance in outcomes and dynamics from changing a single parameter by a small amount.
