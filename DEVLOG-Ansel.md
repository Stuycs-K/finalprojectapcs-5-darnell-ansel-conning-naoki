### 2025-05-26 - initialized processing files, made branch, did Animals class + prey and pred.
Roughly an hour(based on time between commits). First I Wrote the Animals class. Then because Naoki wasn't home yet I initialized the rest of the processing files and pushed them to the main branch. Then I wrote the predator and prey classes but because they reference the bounds of the board I wrote a basic board creation for the setup class.

### 2024-01-03 - Brief description
Expanded description including how much time was spent on task.
