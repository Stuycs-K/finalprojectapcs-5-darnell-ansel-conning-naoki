### 2025-05-26 - initialized processing files, made branch, did Animals class + prey and pred.
Roughly an hour(based on time between commits). First I Wrote the Animals class. Then because Naoki wasn't home yet I initialized the rest of the processing files and pushed them to the main branch. Then I wrote the predator and prey classes but because they reference the bounds of the board I wrote a basic board creation for the setup class.

### 2025-05-27 - worked on all three files
I expanded simulation class so for the future terrain is easier to make. I made the encounter class, added die to prey and other bits to predator for convenience. Most importantly I fixed the classes so they can run. In all between class and home I worked for around 2hrs.
