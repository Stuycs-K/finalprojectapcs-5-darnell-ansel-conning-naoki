# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Ansel Darnell and Naoki Conning

# IDEAS:

1 Our first idea is to simulate population dynamics with kernals. We will play around with migration paterrns and perhaps train a model using real population data.

2 Our second idea is to have an agent based simulation around a sport like football or soccer. This will have specific rules that will dictate how play continues on a tick by tick basis. You will be able to change sliders to allow for differences like agression or even changing the starting positions of the players.

3 Our last idea is to make a chess game on processing. It wont have an ai but will let you play against a friend by flipping the board each turn so you can do "pass and play".
