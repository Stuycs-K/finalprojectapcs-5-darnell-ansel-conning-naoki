### 2025-05-27 - started working on tick process
created spread constructor and started working on transforming main array into 2d array of map. Also started growth/death.

### 2025-05-28 - Continued working on tick process
brainstormed more efficient methods of simulating spread. Continued to work on growth/death. Had trouble pushing from my machine. Will push tomorrow.

### 2025-05-29 - started working on tick process
Redid structure of spread class. Brought diffuse and encounter into the same spread class. 2d map array is now initialized at every tick, but after death and growth which should be slightly more efficient

### 2025-06-07 - Working on diffuse
Finished up encounter,death and growth. Diffuse is not finished


### 2025-06-08 - Working on group encounter, and tick.
encountered many bugs along the process, currently debugging tick.

### 2025-06-09 - Working on group encounter, and tick.
encountered many bugs along the process, currently debugging tick.

### 2025-06-10 - HUGE DAY FOR DEBUGGING. DONE ON CALL W/ ANSEL
Debugged the entire simulation. Rewrote setup, generate animals, valid spawn, generate slope field, display, population counter, draw, Tick mechanic, growth, death, movement, diffuse, encounter probability. HAVE NOT ADDED GROWTH YET. ALSO NEED TO GET GRAPH WORKING. FINAL STEPS.
