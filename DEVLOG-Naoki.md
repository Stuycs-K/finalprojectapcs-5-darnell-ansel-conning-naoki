### 2025-05-27 - started working on tick process
created spread constructor and started working on transforming main array into 2d array of map. Also started growth/death.

### 2025-05-28 - Continued working on tick process
brainstormed more efficient methods of simulating spread. Continued to work on growth/death. Had trouble pushing from my machine. Will push tomorrow.

### 2025-05-29 - started working on tick process
Redid structure of spread class. Brought diffuse and encounter into the same spread class. 2d map array is now initialized at every tick, but after death and growth which should be slightly more efficient
